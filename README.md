The data for this project consists of news articles scraped from the websites using Scrapy, a web crawling framework. The data is stored in a CSV file with the columns you based on the web sources crawled.

The data is assumed to be clean and preprocessed, with no missing values or duplicates.

## Notebooks

The project contains three Jupyter notebooks:

- main.ipynb: this is the main notebook where everything you need is located. It contains the code for loading and exploring the data, building and evaluating the machine learning model, and visualizing the results.
- evaluate_model.ipynb: this notebook is for showing the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix. It also contains some examples of correctly and incorrectly classified articles.
- p-unrest.ipynb: this notebook is for a general overview of the ISNA news agency and the political unrest events in Iran. It was a simple curiosity, further research required for prediction.
